# AutoRota
This project attempts to manually assign rotas to NHS doctors, as many are currently assigned manually by healthcare workers and not admin employees. The backend is implemented in Java, and a website, implemented using React, will call the server.

The rotas are currently undergoing validation by NHS doctors in their spare time.
