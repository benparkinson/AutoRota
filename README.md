# AutoRota
This project attempts to automatically assign rotas to NHS doctors, as many are currently assigned manually by healthcare workers and admin employees. The backend is implemented in Java, using the OptaPlanner library, and the frontend using React.

The rotas annd website are currently undergoing validation by NHS doctors in their spare time. The site is only being used for testing the rota creation and so is still under construction!
